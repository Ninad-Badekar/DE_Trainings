# Flask Form Submission App

This Flask web application collects form submissions and displays them on a webpage.

## Features Covered:
- **Flask Setup**: Basic Flask application structure with a route (`/`).
- **Form Handling**: Accepts user input (`name`, `email`, `message`) via POST requests.
- **Data Storage**: Stores submissions temporarily in memory (list-based).
- **Timestamp Logging**: Records the time each submission is made.
- **HTML Rendering**: Displays submitted data dynamically on the webpage.

### Next Steps:
- Implement a database for persistent storage.
- Add input validation and CSRF protection.
- Improve error handling and user feedback.
