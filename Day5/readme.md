# Big Data Processing: Hadoop, MapReduce, and Apache Spark

Big data processing requires powerful frameworks to handle **large-scale distributed computations** efficiently. Below, we explore **Hadoop, MapReduce, and Apache Spark**, highlighting their workings and differences.

---

## 1️⃣ What is Hadoop & How Does It Work?

### **Overview**
Apache Hadoop is an **open-source framework** designed for storing and processing large-scale data across distributed clusters of computers.

### **Key Components**
1. **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**  
   - Stores data across multiple nodes with **fault tolerance**.
   - Uses **replication** to ensure availability (default: 3 copies).
   - Works with very large datasets efficiently.

2. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**  
   - Manages cluster resources and schedules jobs dynamically.
   - Supports multiple applications running simultaneously.

3. **MapReduce**  
   - The original data processing model in Hadoop.
   - Uses **parallel computing** to process large datasets efficiently.

### **How Hadoop Works?**
1. Data is **split into blocks** and stored across HDFS nodes.
2. Hadoop **distributes** data processing tasks across multiple worker nodes.
3. MapReduce **processes the data in parallel**, reducing computational load.
4. Processed results are **aggregated** and stored for further use.

### **Use Cases**
✔ Handling petabyte-scale structured & unstructured data  
✔ Large-scale data warehousing  
✔ Machine learning preprocessing  
✔ Log analysis for security and monitoring  

---

## 2️⃣ What is MapReduce? How Does It Process Large Data?

### **Overview**
MapReduce is Hadoop’s **distributed computing model** that breaks large datasets into smaller chunks for parallel processing.

### **Two Phases of MapReduce**
1. **Map Phase**
   - Splits data into **key-value pairs**.
   - Each mapper processes only **a portion** of the data.

2. **Reduce Phase**
   - Aggregates intermediate results from mappers.
   - Performs operations like **counting, summing, sorting**.

### **Example: Word Count in MapReduce**
#### **Step 1: Map Phase**
- Input: ["Big data is amazing", "Big data drives insights"]
- Output (Key-Value pairs): big -> 1 data -> 1 is -> 1 amazing -> 1 big -> 1 data -> 1 drives -> 1 insights -> 1


#### **Step 2: Shuffle & Sort Phase**


#### **Step 2: Shuffle & Sort Phase**
Output: big -> [1,1] data -> [1,1] is -> [1] amazing -> [1] drives -> [1] insights -> [1]


#### **Step 3: Reduce Phase**
Final Output: big -> 2 data -> 2 is -> 1 amazing -> 1 drives -> 1 insights -> 1


### **Advantages**
✔ Fault tolerance through distributed execution  
✔ Parallel processing across multiple nodes  
✔ Scalability for large datasets  

### **Limitations**
✖ High disk I/O because of frequent **reads/writes**  
✖ Slow for real-time processing  
✖ Limited support for iterative machine learning workloads

| **Processing Model** | **Batch Processing** only | Supports **Batch + Streaming** |
| **Fault Tolerance** | HDFS replication | **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)** |
| **Ease of Use** | Requires Java/Python coding | Easy API (Python, Scala, SQL) |
| **Machine Learning** | Not optimized | MLlib for ML workloads |
| **Streaming** | External tools needed (Kafka, Flink) | Built-in **Spark Streaming** |

### **Key Features of Spark**
✔ **In-Memory Processing** – Avoids repeated disk reads/writes  
✔ **Unified Engine** – Handles batch, streaming, graph, and ML workloads  
✔ **Fault-Tolerant RDDs** – Recovers lost data without replication overhead
