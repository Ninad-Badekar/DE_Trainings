## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Apache Spark? 

### Overview
Apache Spark is a **fast, distributed computing framework** for processing large-scale data across clusters. It enhances Hadoop‚Äôs **MapReduce** model by performing **in-memory computations**, reducing disk I/O and speeding up execution.

### Core Features:
- **In-Memory Processing** ‚Äì Avoids unnecessary disk writes for faster computation.
- **Distributed Computing** ‚Äì Runs on clusters for scalability.
- **Support for Multiple Languages** ‚Äì **Scala, Python (PySpark), Java, R, SQL**.
- **Unified Engine** ‚Äì Handles **batch processing, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing**.

### Spark Components:
- **Spark Core** ‚Äì Manages cluster resources and execution.
- **Spark SQL** ‚Äì Provides structured querying using SQL.
- **Spark Streaming** ‚Äì Enables real-time data processing.
- **MLlib** ‚Äì Built-in machine learning library.
- **GraphX** ‚Äì Handles graph-based computations.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Does Spark Work? 

Spark processes data **in-memory** using **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)**, avoiding the disk-based bottlenecks of **Hadoop‚Äôs MapReduce**.

### **Key Steps:**
1. **Create an RDD** ‚Äì Load data into Spark‚Äôs distributed collection.
2. **Apply Transformations** ‚Äì Use operations like `map()`, `filter()` (Lazy Evaluation).
3. **Execute Actions** ‚Äì Trigger computation with `count()`, `collect()`, etc.
4. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** ‚Äì Optimizes execution plan before running tasks.
